# Ultima Eclipse

Ultima Eclipse is a free to play Ultima Online shard that has zero PvP.  Start with all skills GM and a nice care package!

## How To Play
---

Our server is heavily modified to bring you features you're not going to find anywhere else.  Using our game launcher allows you to keep your files up to date with our server without having to worry about any of it.

_Our launcher comes with three assistant options - Razor Enhanced, ClassicAssist, and Razor CE_

### ***Via Download***

[Download The Latest Release](https://github.com/UO-Eclipse/Ultima-Eclipse/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)

Extract the downloaded zip file to the location of your choice using a tool such as WinZip, WinRAR or 7-zip.  Run UltimaEclipse.exe as administrator.  Our launcher will set everything up for you - once it is finished, click the assistant of your choice to launch Ultima Eclipse.

### ***Via Git***

If you're familiar with Git, we suggest this method.  It will allow you to git pull any updates to the launcher itself without having to redownload anything.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/UO-Eclipse/Ultima-Eclipse.git ultima-eclipse
```

Run UltimaEclipse.exe as administrator.  Our launcher will set everything up for you - once it is finished, click the assistant of your choice to launch Ultima Eclipse.


## Create an Account
---

Simply log in with your desired Username and Password.  Your account will be created automatically.  You can have up to four free accounts on Eclipse, all you have to do is remember the account information you used to log in for the first time.

## Importing Your Existing Assistant Profiles
---

If you don't want to lose your macros and assistant settings, you can copy them from your current installation(s).  After Ultima Eclipse is installed and updated, you can find the path to put your profiles at these locations:

- ***Razor Enhanced***: data/client/Data/Plugins/RazorEnhanced/Profiles
- ***ClassicAssist***: data/client/Data/Plugins/ClassicAssist/Profiles
- ***Razor CE***: data/client/Data/Plugins/RazorCE/Profiles

_Please note, if you have not launched Ultima Eclipse with the assistant of choice yet, either do so, or create the Profiles directory manually._
